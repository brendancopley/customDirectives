# customDirectives

This is a repository for custom directives I've written that use UI-Bootstrap for Angular 1.5.8

You'll find these custom directives:
1. Accordion (Made Pretty)
2. Tabs (Made Mobile Friendly)
3. Pagination (With Touch Swipe)
4. Carousel (Dynamic On Slide Effects)
5. Image Hover Dimmer (Can be used for whatever on hover image with content to overlay)
6. PHP Mailer Contact Form (With Validation & easy to setup with mail gun api)
7. Delayed State & View Change with Ui-Router (Useful for view animations)
8. Smooth Transition Animations (With Material Design like transitions in mind)
