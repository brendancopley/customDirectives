# customDirectives
</br>
This is a repository for custom directives I've written that use UI-Bootstrap for Angular 1.5.8
</br>
You'll find these custom directives:
</br>
1. Accordion (Made Pretty)
</br>
2. Tabs (Made Mobile Friendly)
</br>
3. Pagination (With Touch Swipe)
</br>
4. Carousel (Dynamic On Slide Effects)
</br>
5. Image Hover Dimmer (Can be used for whatever on hover image with content to overlay)
</br>
6. PHP Mailer Contact Form (With Validation & easy to setup with mail gun api)
</br>
7. Delayed State & View Change with Ui-Router (Useful for view animations)
</br>
8. Smooth Transition Animations (With Material Design like transitions in mind)
